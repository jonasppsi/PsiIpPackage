# Usage
This TCL framework allows to easily package Vivado IP-Cores from tcl scripts. This has many advantages in terms of 
less interactive (and error-prone) packaging, reproducibility and maintainabilit (scripts can easily be version controlled).

## Notes
The framework is written with portability to newer vivado versions in mind. By default, the latest version of Vivado
should be used but it is possible to run the framework for any specific older version of Vivado at any time.
